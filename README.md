# Keyword-Classifier

A keyword Text classifier for SEO analysis using machine learning and deep learning methods.    
The goal is to reduce work time considerably  on classifying keywords into different classes like: Informative, Non-informative, etc   
  
Original Project idea from SCorina (contributor).   
  
The current best classification accuracy achieved is 91 percent using the deep learning model. The training code has not been uploaded yet. Currently working on making the program work better on unseen generalized data.
